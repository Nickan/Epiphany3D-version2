The second version of my Epiphany3D, but now uses steering behavior and implements collision detection. 
Pressing the "D" button will light up the whole world and showing the bounds of all the character. 
There is existing .apk in Epiphany3D-2-android/bin and 
.jar in Epiphany3D-2-desktop/bin for desktop version. 

The character models were made by Mr.Mutte http://www.blendswap.com/user/Mutte. 
Walls and floors from Mr. Reiner Prokein http://www.reinerstilesets.de/

As always, it is powered by http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/

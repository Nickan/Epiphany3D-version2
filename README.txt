The second version of my Epiphany3D, created to further study about steering
behavior, which requires to know about AABB and OBB collision detection.

As of now, the zombies evade each other, thus preventing overlapping each
other while attacking the player and vice versa. Go check it out!

Other features like showing damage and HUD for Hp of zombie and such which
was implemented in the first version might be added (if time permits).

Pressing the "D" button will light up the whole world and showing the 
bounds of all the character.

There is existing .apk in Epiphany3D-2-android/bin and .jar in 
Epiphany3D-2-desktop/bin for desktop version. 

The character models were made by Mr.Mutte http://www.blendswap.com/user/Mutte. 
Walls and floors from Mr. Reiner Prokein http://www.reinerstilesets.de/

As always, it is powered by http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/
